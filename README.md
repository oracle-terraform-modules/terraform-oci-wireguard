_WireGuard &reg; is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes state-of-the-art cryptography. WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances._

This Terraform module automates the deployment of a WireGuard VPN endpoint instance on [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure][uri-oci]. It can be used to enable secure connectivity to private subnets without needing a bastion host or using the Bastion service.
